# Welcome

Hey There. I am Akshay, have a Youtube channel named @AkshayTheBest. I made this repositary to share files of registry files that changes the process/CPU priority of a specific app, in this case - a game. I also made this repositary for people to easily find CPU priority files for games that they could easily download and merge with there Windows PC. Super Simple, Super Effective for you and a lot of work for me (this took 3-5hr).


There are 200+ Games to choose from and you might find the game you want to boost. There are Normal and Medium if the High Setting gives problems

# What is CPU/Process Priority?

It is a setting you can change in the Task Manager that changes the CPU of the PC to give more priority to a cetain app. So basically the CPU gives or takes more resources and RAM/Memory to that app, depending on what setting you use. Which can improve gaming performance if set to a higher CPU Priority.


 There are 6 types of modes but only 3 are vaiable for gaming, which are :
**High**, **Above Normal** and **Normal** 

with Normal being the default.


 *(Irrelevent are : *Real-Time*, *Below Normal* and *Low*)*

Why make registry files (.reg) for it if we can set it inside of Task Manager, you might say. Its because after restarting your PC, the set CPU Priority for that app and you have to redo it. I made this for the gamers so they must be a some lazy gamers so this could help them a lot.


# Disclaimer

Making these registry files needs the execution (.exe) name of the game and since I do now own all the games in the world (and broke), I used ChatGPT and other sources for the exe file names. They could be wrong and I can't test them as I do not have the game so if you find any file not working, please inform me and I will change as soon as possible.

You can check it through Task Manager < Details < {GameName}.exe < Right Click on it < Set Priority and check if your selected process priority is selected over there.

# Didnt find the game you want?

Well have no worries. You can contact me in Discord and say the following :


"Hey, I have came from the Priority Repositary and I want to add the game __________ and its exe name ___________.exe"

(of course you dont have to copy this message but some thing related so I can quickly see it)

# What **I** was going to use it for

I was going to use it for my extremely stripped Windows Built named Essence OS. These files could be pre-installed into the OS and will always perform better as most games are already getting supplied with the highest amount of resources from the CPU and RAM. To get more info, go here : http://essenceos.unaux.com/

*(shameless plug indeed but I need to spread its popularity)*


# Support

If anyone wants to take my files as a port of your source for anything like sharing it to others or in another youtube channel, fine by me. Just give me a small credit with my name or this github repositary or my youtube channel. Its the least you could do for me. ðŸ˜„


# Thank you

Hope you guys be happy from the frustration of copy pasting, changing values, renaming and repeat for 200 games, 3x as there is 3 files each. If you want to distribute it to others, as I said, give a small credit, Thank you. People who are going to use it on online games, you have been warned, I didnt got any problems with mine but there is a chance so be careful. And if there is a file not working, please contact me in discord and we can discuss about it.
